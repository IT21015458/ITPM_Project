SDG TOPIC – Zero Hunger
Project TOPIC - Green Culture

PROBLEM – Currently, many people are helpless in the face of this economic crisis in Sri
Lanka and as a result, getting nutritious food has become a problem. Farmers are also
helpless because they are not getting the right price for their crops. Because these crops are
sold through many middlemen, both the farmer and the consumer are in great financial
difficulty.

SOLUTION - For this, we have taken a web application as an extension, an online market
instead of many middlemen. Here, consumers as well as genuine businessmen can buy
quality vegetables. Here, we focus a lot of attention on the farmers who do organic farming,
but not on a large scale, but to get a reasonable amount for their harvest, as well as provide
an opportunity for consumers to get quality vegetables. Also, for those who are doing
farming, an opportunity has been provided to the educated people in the field to share their
knowledge for correct counseling and correct awareness. Also, this web application has
facilitated the farmers to ask their problems and get answers to them, to get information
about the latest news and latest discoveries related to agriculture.
